    <h3><a href="https://github.com/kwinters-snhu/CS-499-worker/tree/milestone-1">Initial Version</a></h3>
    <p>This artifact is a worker service that receives AMQ messages, looks up the task barcode of the message, and either inserts a new or updates
    the existing header and line objects from the message into a database, depending on if the barcode already exists or not.  I chose this artifact
    because it has a lot of room for improvement, and because I have had a hand in guiding the overall project and infrastructure that it inhabits 
    (it's part of a much larger system), so it demonstrates my ability to collaborate with a wide array of stakeholders and users, and design and
    implement software solutions.  It was originally deployed to OpenShift as a POC and had a lot of messy code.  Throughout this course, I will be 
    improving the code and preparing for a transition from OpenShift to Google Cloud Run.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/kwinters-snhu/CS-499-worker/tree/swe-enhancement">Software Engineering Enhancement</a></h3>
    <p>In this enhancement, I have refactored the code and added services to connect frontend and backend.  I added security and performance fixes, 
    and unit tests to verify logic.  I added schema validation, business logic validation, error handling, and logging.  Additional improvements
    were added in later enhancements, as well, and learned how to use Docker to push the image to GCP.</p>
