            The work below showcases my strengths, goals, and values, and meets
            each of the criteria for our capstone course. My software
            engineering values are testability, reusability, team/org
            collaboration and standards, user focus, tracer bullet development,
            and agility in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment.

            <h4>Outcome: Collaborating in a Team Environment</h4>
            <p>
              Throughout the course, I worked with our AMQ broker team to
              configure and test our topic subscriptions as needed. This was
              necessary as we weren't permitted to download our own broker
              software. I also worked with our data design team to review/define
              new database naming standards of old tables/columns with very
              difficult to read names. In addition, I am continuing to work with
              architects, our manager, and our enterprise platform engineering
              team to design, budget, plan, and implement new infrastructure.
              Lastly, a staggering number of requests and forms have been
              required. To facilitate collaboration, whenever I requested access
              or resources for anything, I made sure to request it for the whole
              team, and actively shared discoveries during our tech review
              calls.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="outcome-card">
            <h4>Outcome: Communicating with Stakeholders</h4>
            <p>
              Througout the development process, I have maintained a OneNote
              that our team shares, documenting all discovered requirements,
              processes, and team decisions. I created an unofficial HLA to help
              onboard our architect, activity diagrams to use in discussions,
              and spreadsheet to help define data. For the course, I created
              several videos and written documents describing the artifacts and
              how to use/test them, and a polished github pages portfolio.
            </p>

          <div class="outcome-card">
            <h4>Outcome: Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
            <p>
              I created an in-memory cache for a frequently repeated lookup, and
              implemented a binary search lookup and ConcurrentDictionary lookup
              version, which was easy to test and swap out depending on which
              was the better performing lookup.

          <div class="outcome-card">
            <h4>Outcome: Software Engineering and Database</h4>
            <p>
              For each enhancement, I iteratively expanded the included business
              logic/functionality, cleaned up legacy code, and refactored for
              clean code and org standards. I also began moving infrastructure
              from Openshift to GCP (in progress) - a feat which I was hoping to
              complete before the end of the course, but which I knew would be
              dependent on external teams and unknown processes. Loggingm, error
              handling, and unit tests were often absent in legacy code, so I
              improved both in this iteration. Other legacy issues involved
              concurrency bugs, and I designed with that history in mind,
              creating unit tests to prevent regressions as more functionality
              is added. I rewrote a SQL Server schema, stored procedures, and
              legacy data access code for AlloyDB/PostgreSQL, improved the
              consistency of data access code, and revised schema names to be
              human readable.

          <div class="outcome-card">
            <h4>Outcome: Security Mindset</h4>
            <p>
              I added xml schema and domain validation for inputs, designed
              infrastructure to include redundancy and DR planning, AlloyDB auth
              proxy, VPN, and service accounts/role restrictions. At a previous
              team/company, I served as a "security advocate" (responsible for
              integrating security scans into our pipelines, tracking and
              mitigating security defects, flagging false results, taking extra
              security training, etc), so I am aware of how important these
              scans are and have been prioritizing getting the quality and
              security scans working in our CI pipelines. This has been an
              ongoing process as our pipeline team works through issues.

            CS-499-worker is a .NET 8.0 worker service that uses AMQPNetLite to
            subscribe to multiple AMQ topics from a message broker. It processes
            the messages, extracts a few entities, and adds them to tables in
            the "SMAT" database (CS-499-database). It also checks the message
            barcode in the database and inserts the entities with "New" status
            if not found, or "Updated" if found.

                While the AMQP Subscription portion of the code is new, much of
                the database and business logic code was hastily pulled and
                adapted from a legacy system. The AMQP was all that I really
                needed to test as part of the effort to build out the new
                infrastructure, and I planned to refactor and clean up the rest
                once that concept was proven. This made it a great candidate for
                the Software Engineering enhancement.

                  In this enhancement, I have refactored the code and added
                  services to connect frontend and backend. I added security and
                  performance fixes, and unit tests to verify logic. I added
                  schema validation, business logic validation, error handling,
                  and logging (additional improvements were added in later
                  enhancements, as well), and learned how to use Docker to push
                  the image to GCP. Infrastructure changes were started, but due
                  to organizational processes, this effort will likely be
                  ongoing after the class and may not be included in this
                  iteration.

                    <strong>Collaboration:</strong> This enhancement required
                    collaboration with the AMQ Broker team to provide schemas,
                    integration tests, and planning for message handling and
                    protocol for issues. The ongoing design and implementation
                    of the application and infrastructure required collaboration
                    with our architects, enterprise engineering team, and GCP
                    sandbox/terraform repo management teams.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Communication:</strong> I created the original HLA
                    and additional documentation to serve as foundations for
                    discussion and planning with the team. I meticulously
                    documented all of our processes, discussions, architecture,
                    and how-tos in a shared OneNote so that anyone who does not
                    have experience can take over at any time. I also improved
                    commenting and documentation within the code itself.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Innovation:</strong> Our team does not have many
                    examples of .NET applications or AlloyDB in GCP/Cloud Run.
                    It has been a pleasure to work with our architects,
                    engineers, and other teams also learning about this
                    technology as we create and share new solutions.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Adding schema validation
                    for the XML messages, and additional business logic
                    validation improved security significantly, as input/output
                    validation is one of the most important foundational steps
                    to prevent unauthorized changes to data. Additional updates
                    are made in later enhancements, and will continue to be made
                    as our scan reports become available.

                  The legacy system that some of the business logic and database
                  code was pulled from has a history of concurrency issues and
                  dropped messages. For that reason, I wanted to pay extra close
                  attention to how data is being accessed, stored, and updated
                  or deleted. The barcode lookup and lock, in particular, caused
                  issues when multiple messages were received at the same time
                  and processed at the same time on multiple threads or servers.
                  The need to quickly search for the barcode and handle it
                  concurrently made it a good candiate for the Data Structures

                  of a barcode lookup algorithm and/or data structure. The first

                    <strong>Design and Algorithms:</strong> I created a binary

                    frequency of database lookups. I designed the components in
                    a way to easily isolate and test the services, and swap them
                    out depending on the results. I also created a test to

                <p>
                  The service is part of a much larger ecosystem of
                  microservices at my company. It was created a few months ago
                  both for business requirements and as a POC for adoption of
                  new pipeline systems, and I worked with various teams to
                  implement and deploy it via enterprise pipelines using Azure
                  DevOps, Openshift, and ArgoCD. However, the enterprise is now
                  switching to GCP, Cloud Run, and AlloyDB, and because we are
                  planning to use AI solutions to read data, the legacy tables
                  and columns must be renamed to be more readable (this will
                  also help the humans). For that reason, the application must
                  be tweaked for for those platforms, and the database must be
                  rewritten from SQL Server to AlloyDB/PostgreSQL. That made it
                  a perfect candiate for the Database enhancement.

                <p>
                  For this enhancement, I had to learn about AlloyDB, GCP,
                  Terraform, and PostgreSQL, as my prior experience was mostly
                  with SQL Server. I worked with our database design teams to
                  understand the meaning of the table and column abbreviations
                  and adopt/define new standards for naming, and rewrote the
                  tables, columns, and stored procedures for AlloyDB/PostgreSQL.
                  I updated the Data Access layer in the worker service so that
                  it uses the correct libraries, and improved the legacy code to
                  be async and consistent in format. I began setting up the
                  clusters, instances, databases, networking, service accounts,
                  etc, as well. Infrastructure work has required
                  outreach/dependency on external teams, and as a result is
                  still in progress.

                    <strong>Collaboration:</strong> This enahncement required
                    collaboration with our enterprise data design team to ensure
                    that our changes are consistent with organziational
                    standards. It also required heavy collaboration with our
                    architect and enterprise engineering team to work out
                    access, permissions, procedures, budgeting, and cloud
                    resource allocation. I have shared knowledge that I learned
                    while deploying builds to GCP with teams that are struggling
                    with that, and a team that focused on database first has
                    been working with me on setting up a local connection.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Communication:</strong> I created a spreadsheet with
                    our old table and column definitions and an updated version
                    to use in meetings with our team and the database design
                    team.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Design and Algorithms:</strong> I improved the
                    database code to standardize it, make it easy to swap out,
                    and ensure it is async. While working about this, I learned
                    about the PostgreSQL advisory lock, and plan to use it to
                    implement the barcode locking mechanism. The existing unit
                    tests will help me verify that no concurrency regressions
                    occur as we continue to build out the remaining business
                    logic.

                    <strong>Innovation: </strong> We are designing our database
                    to be compatible with planned AI initiatives, and creating
                    new processes for GCP/AlloyDB.

                    <strong>Security Mindset: </strong> Creating service
                    accounts, permissions, and working out details around the
                    auth proxy and tunneling, shows that we are prioritizing
                    security, even for our sandbox POC solutions. We are
                    including multiple instances and load balancing in our
                    infrastructure, as well, to ensure we can support
                    scalability and disaster recovery plans.

            My passion is building applications from the ground up to be
            well-designed and testable. I plan to use the remaining courses of
            this program to learn to develop geospatial applications. Beyond
            this program, I want to expand into AR/VR, but with the rate of
            change in technology, I can't wait to see what other opportunities
            present themselves.
